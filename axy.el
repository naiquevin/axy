;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Axy is short for *A*d hoc e*X*pansion of *Y*asnippets!
;;
;; This file attempts to provide the following workflow:
;;
;;  1. quickly find a yasnippet from anywhere (regardless of the major
;;  mode in the current buffer)
;;
;;  2. expand it in a temp buffer, allowing user to make changes (like
;;  a regular yasnippet)
;;
;;  3. copy the output to clipboard and close the temp buffer
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; The package is not yet uploaded on any of the emacs package
;; repositories. For now, you can clone the repo in an accessible
;; location and somehow load this file. Then just set a global
;; keybinding to invoke the `axy/find-&-expand-snippet` fn.
;;
;; If you use `use-package`, you may add the following lines to your
;; emacs config:
;;
;;     (use-package axy
;;       :ensure nil
;;       :requires (yasnippet dash)
;;       :after (yasnippet)
;;       :load-path /location/to/axl/repo
;;       :config
;;       (global-set-key (kbd "C-c ;") 'axy/find-&-expand-snippet))
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Assuming that the global keybinding mentioned above is set, you can
;; type `C-c ;` from anywhere to invoke the
;; `axy/find-&-expand-snippet` fn.
;;
;; It will first prompt for a major mode. Upon selecting the major
;; mode, it will prompt you to select the snippet from a list of
;; snippets eligible for that mode. On selecting a snippet, a new
;; temporary buffer will open, initiating the expansion of the
;; selected snippet. Once all the placeholders are entered, you can
;; use the `axy-mode` specific keybinding `C-;`, to copy the expanded
;; snippet to clipboard and also cleanup the temporary buffer.
;;
;; The code also provides a minor mode named `axy-mode` which is only
;; meant for the temporary buffer mentioned above. There's no need to
;; manually enable it in any other buffers.
;;
;; Known issues:
;;
;; The code depends on some of the internal functions from the
;; yasnippet package. So if the API of these fns changes in future
;; releases, it could break `axy`.
